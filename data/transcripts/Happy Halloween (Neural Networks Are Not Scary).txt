 Don't be afraid of narrow networks they're not scary. Even when a narrow network says boo, hello, I'm Josh Starmer host of the StacQuest with Josh Starmer YouTube channel and I'm here to say that neural networks are not scary. Now the term neural network may sound really fancy and complicated but all a neural network does is fit a squiggle or a bent shape to data. For example, if you've got a data set like this then a neural network can fit a squiggle to that data. Bam! And if you've got a fancier data set like this then a neural network can fit a bent shape to that data. Double bam! And if you've got a crazy complicated data set like this, well a neural network can still fit a squiggle or a bent shape to that data. Triple bam! Hurray!
